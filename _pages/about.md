I am an Assistant Professor of Finance at Universidad Javeriana - Bogotá. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from Copenhagen Business School (CBS) in 2024. My research interests combine International Finance, Applied Macroeconomics, and Financial Economics. My most recent interests are Carry Trade, Capital Flows, and the use of Foreign Exchange Reserves.

## Latest Version of the Paper

**Job Market Paper: The Uncertain Exorbitant Privilege and Duty**

This paper examines how shocks to exchange rate and macroeconomic uncertainty affect the United States' net foreign asset (NFA) position. I employ a structural VAR that combines external instruments, narrative (event) inequalities, and shock-dependent restrictions to address endogeneity in uncertainty measures and their links to net portfolio flows. I find that both exchange rate and macroeconomic uncertainty shocks reduce the United States' NFA deficit, with macroeconomic uncertainty exerting a larger and more persistent effect than exchange rate uncertainty. The NFA improvement is accompanied by greater macroeconomic fluctuations in the short run but dampened volatility at longer horizons. In addition, macroeconomic uncertainty raises exchange rate volatility, whereas higher exchange rate uncertainty tends to dampen macroeconomic uncertainty. These results are consistent with the convenience-yield and dominant-currency pricing literatures.

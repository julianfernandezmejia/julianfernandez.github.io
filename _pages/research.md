### The Uncertain Exorbitant Privilege and Duty

This paper examines how shocks to exchange rate and macroeconomic uncertainty affect the United States' net foreign asset (NFA) position. I employ a structural VAR that combines external instruments, narrative (event) inequalities, and shock-dependent restrictions to address endogeneity in uncertainty measures and their links to net portfolio flows. I find that both exchange rate and macroeconomic uncertainty shocks reduce the United States' NFA deficit, with macroeconomic uncertainty exerting a larger and more persistent effect than exchange rate uncertainty. The NFA improvement is accompanied by greater macroeconomic fluctuations in the short run but dampened volatility at longer horizons. In addition, macroeconomic uncertainty raises exchange rate volatility, whereas higher exchange rate uncertainty tends to dampen macroeconomic uncertainty. These results are consistent with the convenience-yield and dominant-currency pricing literatures, heightened volatility rebalances foreign demand toward United States safe assets and transmits through global terms of trade and financing conditions.
